## Homework 8: Files

### Assignment 1

This program performs file copying from a source file (`src.txt`) to a destination file (`dest.txt`). It opens both files and transfers their contents byte by byte and at the same time keeps the count of bytes transfered.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INPUT] Input Source File Path: src.txt
[INFO] Source File Detected... 
[INPUT] Input Destination File Path: dest.txt
[INFO] Destination File Detected... 
[INFO] Opening Source File... 
[INFO] Opening Destination File... 
[INFO] Performing Data Transfer and Byte Count... 
[TASK] Total bytes copied: 71
[INFO] Completing Program... 
```

### Assignment 2

This program performs the truncation of a file to reduce its size. A file is first written with some content and then truncated to 10 bytes using `ftruncate()`.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INFO] Creating File and Writing Data to it... 
[TASK] Original size: 26 bytes
[INFO] Truncating File... 
[TASK] Truncated Size: 10 bytes
[TASK] Remaining Content: ABCDEFGHIJ
[INFO] Completing Program... 
```
### Assignment 3

This program reverses the contents of a given text file. It reads all data from the file, reverses the character order, and writes the reversed text back to the same file.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program... 
Input Source File Path: data.txt
[INFO] File Opened With No Issues... 
[INFO] Reversing Data Inside the file...

### Assignment 4

This program appends log messages to a file while printing the current file offset after each write. The program uses the `O_APPEND` flag to ensure that every write happens at the end of the file.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INFO] Opening File in Append Mode... 
[INPUT] Input log message: First 
[INFO] Writing Log Message to the File... 
[INFO] Getting The Offset... 
[TASK] Current File Offset: 21
[INFO] Completing Program... 

[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INFO] Opening File in Append Mode... 
[INPUT] Input log message: Second
[INFO] Writing Log Message to the File... 
[INFO] Getting The Offset... 
[TASK] Current File Offset: 41
[INFO] Completing Program... 

[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INFO] Opening File in Append Mode... 
[INPUT] Input log message: Third
[INFO] Writing Log Message to the File... 
[INFO] Getting The Offset... 
[TASK] Current File Offset: 60
[INFO] Completing Program... 
```


#### File Content
```
PID=1581032: First 
PID=1581038: Second
PID=1581044: Third
```



### Assignment 5

This program creates a sparse file by writing data at non-contiguous offsets. The program writes the word `START`, seeks forward by 1 MiB, and then writes `END`, resulting in a large apparent file with mostly unallocated blocks.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program... 
[INFO] Opening the File... 
[INFO] Writing 'START' to File... 
[INFO] Adding Skip for 1MiB... 
[INFO] Writing 'END' to File... 
[INFO] Opening File in readonly... 
[TASK] Apparent file size: 1048584 bytes
[INFO] Completing Program... 
```
### Assignment 6

This program identifies the offset of line 4, replaces it with 100 and rewrites the remaining content. At the end it prints the final version to verify final file content.

#### Execution Output
```
[INFO] Starting Program...
[INFO] Creating and Opening the File...
[INFO] Writing numbers 1 to 10 into numbers.txt ...
[INFO] Reopening the File for Read/Write...
[INFO] Splitting content into lines...
[INFO] Replacing line 4 with '100'...
[INFO] Truncating and rewriting the file...
[INFO] Verifying the final content of numbers.txt:

```
### Assignment 7
This program reads both files in chunks and compares them byte by byte.
In result it reports first differing byte or confirms identity.
Here `file1.txt` and `file3.txt` were identical, `file2.txt` differed at byte 18.
#### Execution Ooutput (Case 1 - One Letter Difference)
```
[INFO] Starting Program...
[INPUT] Input First File Path: file1.txt
[INPUT] Input Second File Path: file2.txt
[INFO] Opening files for comparison...
[INFO] Beginning byte-by-byte comparison...
[TASK] Files differ at byte 18
```

#### Execution Ooutput (Case 2 - Identical Files)
```
[INFO] Starting Program...
[INPUT] Input First File Path: file1.txt
[INPUT] Input Second File Path: file2.txt
[INFO] Opening files for comparison...
[INFO] Beginning byte-by-byte comparison...
[TASK] Files are identical...
[INFO] Completing Program...
```
